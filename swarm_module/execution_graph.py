"""Dependency-driven execution graph for coordinating multiple agents.

The graph models each :class:`Agent` instance as a vertex and each directed
connection as a dependency edge. An agent becomes runnable as soon as all of
its direct predecessors have completed.

The execution model supports the following common topologies:

- Pass-through: one agent forwards its output to one successor.
- Fan-out: one agent broadcasts its output to multiple successors.
- Fan-in: one agent waits for multiple predecessors and aggregates their
  outputs before execution.

Additional features:

- **Mapper** (node-level): a single callable on any agent that transforms all
  predecessor outputs into the agent's input message (``set_mapper``).
  Without a mapper, a single predecessor's output is passed through directly,
  and multiple predecessors' outputs are joined with source labels.
- **Router**: dynamic successor selection — after an agent completes, a
  router function decides which downstream agents to activate.  Non-LLM
  routing nodes (``add_routing_node``) can be used as lightweight decision
  points without an Agent instance.

Dynamic mutation at runtime
---------------------------
The graph supports **runtime mutation** during :meth:`ExecutionGraph.run`:

- :meth:`dynamic_add_agent` / :meth:`dynamic_remove_agent`
- :meth:`dynamic_add_connection`

These are thread-safe and designed to be called from within an agent's tool
handlers (e.g. a coordinator LLM dynamically spawning workers).

A coordinator agent can build a sub-graph on the fly::

    # Inside a coordinator's tool handler:
    graph.dynamic_add_agent("worker_1", worker_agent)
    graph.dynamic_add_connection("coordinator", "worker_1")

When the coordinator finishes, the scheduler automatically activates its
successors — including agents added dynamically during its execution.

.. important::

   Connections must be added **before** the source agent completes.
   Adding a connection *from an already-finished agent* has no effect
   because the source's successors have already been activated.

Agents whose dependencies are satisfied are scheduled concurrently through a
thread pool. Thread-based execution is appropriate for agents whose primary
work consists of network or other I/O-bound operations.

The graph must be acyclic.
